# Exploring Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
Welcome to "Exploring Artificial Neural Networks," a repository that dives deep into the mechanics and applications of neural networks. This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that guides you through both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of artificial neural networks.

## Contents
- **Artificial_NeuralNetworks.ipynb**: This notebook is structured to offer a detailed exploration into artificial neural networks, including:
  - Theoretical concepts behind neural networks.
  - Step-by-step Python code implementations.
  - Training models on various datasets.
  - Application and evaluation of these models.

## How to Use
To use the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, ensure you have Jupyter installed and simply open the notebook to view the contents. Run the cells directly to see the code in action.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.
- Libraries needed: TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These can be installed via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
  ```
