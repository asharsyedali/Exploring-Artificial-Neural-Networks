## Overview
Welcome to "Exploring Artificial Neural Networks," a repository that dives deep into the mechanics and applications of neural networks. This repository hosts a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that guides you through both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of artificial neural networks.

## Contents

| File Name                     | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Artificial_NeuralNetworks.ipynb` | Comprehensive notebook covering theoretical concepts, Python implementations, training on datasets, and applications of neural networks. |

## How to Use
To use the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, ensure you have Jupyter installed and simply open the notebook to view the contents. Run the cells directly to see the code in action.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.
- Libraries needed: TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These can be installed via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
  ```

### Enhancements
1. **Badges**: Badges serve as quick visual references for software versions or project status. They are added at the top for quick visibility.
2. **Tables**: The contents section uses a table format to neatly list and describe the files contained in the repository.
3. **Section Dividers**: Horizontal lines (---) are used to clearly separate different sections, helping to organize the content better.

These additions make your README file more visually appealing and easier to navigate. If you'd like to see more formatting options or specific elements added, let me know!
